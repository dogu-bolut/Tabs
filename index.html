              My journey started with game development at my first year of university.
              I liked a fact that I can play my games. My idea my rules right?. I could've make
              a game about strugles of hero dog try to reach earth core. That drove me about
              3 years and I enjoyed being a game developer but, when I take my head out of sand
              I saw others game developers make hyper casual type boring games. I was set my goal
              to work in world famous AAA Game Companies. One week lifespan Hyper Casual games
              can't help me to achieve my dream work. I decided to learn how to earn a place
              in AAA Game Companies. I choosed path of server developer which suits perfect
              for me because I do love coding. This enlightment changed my way. I'm using
              javascript now and learning nodeJS. One day I will be part of a company
              of my dream work.

              My vision about my career is gathered around self-improvement in job related skills.
              I do believe who works hard and smart has better advantage in this area. I certainly
              want to be coder who got respect from others and wise about every detail in job
              description covers. My vision about future of this title will be more deeper than
              now due to artificial intelligence and, hell yes i would love to see how far can computers
              go. Even better then seeing their evolution is understanding and making adjustments in
              that area.

              My goal is fairly simple: "Having fun while work". My journey was mostly delightful
              because I enjoyed to study and work as developer. It's not "wait for weekend" type
              of job for me. Never will be if I wouldn't let it becomes to my burden. I would love
              to make a good money of course. I would love to have a team to manage at some point.
              But this are not primary, I will have the joy then rest will come automatically.
